    "## Basic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with vector spaces. Linear algebra operations such as transposes, dot products, matrix multiplications and others are often very useful when manipulating numeric datasets. Using these operations often allows us to avoid writing explicit loops, and thus make our code more readable, more concise and faster to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following steps we'll implement linear regression using `numpy` linear algebra operations. We will start with the functional form of the regression: how the predicted target values depend on the regression coefficients the of features (aka predictors or regressors). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the coefficients $\\beta$ and the matrix with the predictors $X$ we can calculate predicted targets $\\hat{y}$ according to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\beta_0 + X\\beta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add an extra column with all $1$s to the matrix $\\mathrm{X}$, we can write this without the intercept $\\beta_0$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = X\\beta\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is the matrix multiplication. In this case the first matrix is $N\\times M$ where N is the number datapoints (rows) and $M$ the number of predictors (including the extra row of ones). The second matrix is $M\\times 1$, so it is a column vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this particular case, for each row of M we multiply it with $\\beta$ and the sum these multiplications is our predicted $\\hat{y}$ for each row. This can be written explicitly as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y}_i = \\sum_{m=1}^M X_{i,m} \\beta_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the matrix multiplication version is much more concise. The same is true in numpy code: it's more concise to implement this using the matrix multiplication function `numpy.dot` than write a bunch of loops.\n"
